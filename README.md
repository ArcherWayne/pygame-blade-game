## 想要实现的游戏效果

### 英雄

- 存在一个英雄, 是玩家操作的角色. 
- 英雄具备血量, 伤害, 移速, 攻击距离, 攻击前摇和攻击后摇等属性. 
- 英雄有一个攻击距离, 右键点击小兵后首先会移动到攻击距离以内, 然后释放一个弹道. 
- 弹道具备弹道速度属性. 
- 弹道会一直以被点击小兵为目标匀速移动, 直到弹道和被点击小兵碰撞, 对被点击小兵造成伤害. 
  > 存在近战英雄, 攻击范围非常小, 但不等于0. 其弹道速度为最大值. 即弹道所消耗的时间为0. 

### 小兵
- 存在多个小兵, 是游戏事件按时间生成的角色.
- 小兵存在血量, 伤害, 移速, 攻击距离, 攻击前摇和攻击后摇等属性. 
  > 小兵的属性可能随游戏设计变化而修改. 
- 小兵存在非仇恨状态和仇恨状态两个不同的状态. 
- 当小兵与英雄或防御塔的距离大于一定值时, 小兵处于非仇恨状态, 时刻匀速向屏幕左边移动. 
- 当小兵与英雄或防御塔的距离小于一定值时, 小兵处于仇恨状态, 向英雄或防御塔进行移动. 
- 当小兵与英雄或防御塔的距离小于小兵攻击范围时, 小兵将对英雄或防御塔进行攻击. 攻击的对象由仇恨的目标决定. 
  >小兵对英雄的仇恨优先级高于小兵对防御塔的仇恨, 但是若???? 若什么若, 仇恨系统还没想好, 嘿几把

#### 小兵的仇恨系统

#### 小兵的刷兵逻辑

### 防御塔
- 存在两座防御塔, 自动对最近的小兵单位进行弹道攻击. 
- 防御塔存在血量, 伤害, 攻击间隔, 弹道速度等属性. 
- 防御塔可以使用金钱进行升级. 每次升级恢复一定的血量. 

### 补刀系统

## The intended game mechanics

### HERO

- There is a hero of which the player controls. 
- The hero contains attributes such as health, damage, movement speed, attacking foreswing and attacking backswing.
- The hero has an attacking range where the hero will move into when right-clicked on a creep and then release a projectile.
- The projectile has a speed attribute.
- The projectile will move at a constant speed with the right-clicked creep as the target until a collision occurs between the two, then the right-clicked creep receives damage.
  > There is melee hero with very low, but not 0, attacking range, whose projectile speed is maximum. That is, no delay between initiating an attack and landing an attack.

### CREEP
- There are multiple creep NPCs, which are characters generated by game events over time. 
- Creeps have attributes such as health, damage, movement speed, attack distance, foreswing and backswing.
   > The attributes of creeps may be modified as the game design changes.
- Creeps have two different states: non-aggro state and aggro state.
- When the distance between the creep and the hero or defense tower is greater than a certain value, the creep is in a non-aggro state and moves to the left of the screen at a constant speed.
- When the distance between the creep and the hero or defense tower is less than a certain value, the creep is in a state of aggro and moves to the hero or tower.
- When the distance between the creep and the hero or defense tower is less than the creep's attack range, the minion will attack the hero or tower. The target of the attack is determined by the target of aggro.

### DEFENSE TOWER
- There are two defense tower, which automatically launch ballistic attacks on the nearest creep unit when in range.
- Towers have attributes such as HP, damage, attack interval, and projectile speed.
- Defense towers can be upgraded with money. Each upgrade restores a certain amount of HP.

### LAST HIT
- The last-hit system is the core gameplay of the game.
- When the creep's HP is set to 0 or less by the hero's attack, the hero will receive a certain amount of money as a reward.
